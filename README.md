This is my second react project were i have created News App with News API to render latest news in my application.


## News API

To check out the news API, click [here](https://newsapi.org/). After that, log in to the news API by filling up some basic details like `Name, Email, Password,` and get your API key. After you are logged in, you will see your `live API key` in every example. I have used the `Top headlines Endpoint` for my application.
